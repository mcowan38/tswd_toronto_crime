B.3 Getting started
cd "C:\Users\Mcowa\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\tswd_toronto_crime" 	# change directory to GitHub repo
uv init toronto_crime 							# creates project-specific virtual environment (.venv appears)
									# projectâ€™s dependencies (polars, numpy, etc.) installed and isolated.
uv add polars numpy datetime pydantic					# add packages
									# polars: manipulating dfs, similar to pandas; https://pola.rs/
									# numpy: simulating data (numbers/arrays); https://numpy.org/
									# datetime: similar to lubridate (R); https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
									# pydantic: for validation (checking rows, etc.); https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/

Acquire data added (02-download_data.py).
- Initially saved as a paraquet (https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/21-python_essentials.html).
- Realized maintaining original .csv and .xlsx is fine here. Deleted paraquet files and added files via write_csv and write_excel (xlsxwriter).
- Auto-complete was on from multiple prior extensions in VScode. Disabled with settings.json (and turned off extensions).
- Removed .qodo folder; disabled Qodo Gen and Path Intellisense extensions.
