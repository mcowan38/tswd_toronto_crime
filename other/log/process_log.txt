# B.2 Python, VS Code, and uv
Installed via pip (replacing pip as a package installer?) in Command Prompt [-m pip install --upgrade uv]
- Prompted to install upgraded new release of pip: 25.0.1 -> 25.1.1

# Terminal/Shell
- Terminal: text-based interface where you type commands to interact with your computer.
- Shell: program that interprets these commands.

# Printing messages (f-string literals)
- e.g., print(f"Hello, {name}!") 	# prints "Hello, name!" to the terminal (f-string literal)

Shell Type:					Platform:			Example Syntax:
PowerShell					Windows				Get-ChildItem, ls, python
CMD (Command Prompt)		Windows				dir, cd, copy
Bash (e.g. Git Bash)		Linux/macOS			ls, cd, ./run.sh
Zsh / Fish					Unix shells			Like Bash, with extras
R, Python shells			Language REPLs		For writing in R or Python interactively

# B.3 Getting started
- cd "C:\Users\Mcowa\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\tswd_toronto_crime" 	# change directory to GitHub repo
- uv init toronto_crime 					# creates project-specific virtual environment (.venv appears)
											# projectâ€™s dependencies (polars, numpy, etc.) installed and isolated.

- uv add polars numpy datetime pydantic		# add packages
											# polars: manipulating dfs, similar to pandas; https://pola.rs/
											# numpy: simulating data (numbers/arrays); https://numpy.org/
											# datetime: similar to lubridate (R); https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
											# pydantic: for validation (checking rows, etc.); https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/

- pip freeze > requirements.txt				# creates a requirements.txt file with all packages and versions
									
# Acquire data added (02-download_data.py).
- Initially saved as a paraquet (https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/21-python_essentials.html).
- Realized maintaining original .csv and .xlsx is fine here. Deleted paraquet files and added files via write_csv and write_excel (xlsxwriter).
- Auto-complete was on from multiple prior extensions in VScode. Disabled with settings.json (and turned off extensions).
- Removed .qodo folder; disabled Qodo Gen and Path Intellisense extensions.

# Based on the starter_folder repo, I'm guessing I had too many local files visible in the online repository (unnecessary).
- Found a template and updated .gitignore while removing files/folder from the cache.

# Updated README.md with Title and repo details (work in progress).

# Data cleaning
- Going to clean first to reduce the excessive amount of columns (will have a better idea of parameters for simulation).
- Found documentation for what would be the equivalent of a R "select" in polars.
- Cleaning in 2 separate spreadsheets (will join by neighbourhood after).

# Sketches
- Added dataset sketch.
- Added graph sketch.
- Analysis could be more detailed than a regression.

# Simulate Data
- Stuck on which distributions are appropriate to simulate the data (not enough clarity from TSWD given I haven't touched Poisson/beta etc. before).
- Found something that seems to break them down (https://vitalflux.com/types-probability-distributions-defined-examples/), will ask for clarity.
- Poisson distribution; mean variance the same, remember one parameter.

# Clean & Merge
- Cleaned both datasets sticking to Polars (had to transpose). Couldn't figure out the leftover row in the online documentation

# Changed my idea (looking at something different now, focusing on descriptive rather than regression)

# Realized I'm downloading in the way that wasn't instructed (supposed to use API) so updated script to query the API.
